## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting the presence of heart disease using clinical patient data. The goal is not only to train a machine learning model, but also to demonstrate production-ready machine learning practices including data versioning, experiment tracking, automated testing, continuous integration, and model monitoring.

The project uses a Heart Disease dataset containing demographic, clinical, and diagnostic measurements to classify whether a patient has heart disease. The pipeline is designed to be reproducible, maintainable, and extensible, following industry-standard MLOps workflows.

## Problem Statement

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early identification of individuals at risk can support timely intervention and improve health outcomes.

This project builds a classification model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient characteristics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, electrocardiogram results, and other clinical indicators.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* MLflow
* DVC
* Pytest
* GitHub Actions
* Evidently
* YAML

---

## MLOps Components

### Data Versioning (DVC)

The dataset is tracked using DVC rather than Git to enable reproducible experimentation and efficient version control of large files.

### Experiment Tracking (MLflow)

Each training run logs:

* Model hyperparameters
* Dataset version
* Evaluation metrics
* Trained model artifacts

Experiments can be compared programmatically using `compare_experiments.py`.

### Automated Testing (Pytest)

The project includes:

#### Preprocessing Tests

* Missing value handling
* Categorical encoding validation
* Data integrity checks
* Error handling validation

#### Data Validation Tests

* Required columns exist
* Target values are valid
* Numeric feature ranges are reasonable

#### Model Validation Tests

* Prediction shape verification
* Minimum performance threshold validation

### Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

The CI/CD pipeline automatically:

1. Installs dependencies
2. Executes the test suite
3. Trains the model
4. Verifies model performance requirements

### Drift Monitoring (Evidently)

The monitoring pipeline compares reference training data against simulated production data to detect feature drift and identify when retraining may be necessary.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd heart-disease-prediction
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

### Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running Training

Train the model:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

The training script:

* Loads configuration values from `config.yaml`
* Preprocesses the data
* Trains the model
* Evaluates performance
* Logs metrics and artifacts to MLflow

---

## Running Multiple Experiments

src/train.py above logs a single run from config.yaml. To generate the 5+ meaningfully different runs used for model selection, run:

```bash
python src/run_experiments.py
```

This logs 7 configurations spanning five algorithm families — three RandomForest variants, GradientBoosting, LogisticRegression, SVC, and KNN — each as its own MLflow run with full hyperparameters, metrics, and the model artifact attached.

## Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

---

## MLflow Experiment Tracking

Launch the MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Then navigate to:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

View:

* Experiment runs
* Parameters
* Metrics
* Model artifacts

---

## Comparing Experiments

Identify the best-performing experiment:

```bash
python src/compare_experiments.py
```

The script queries MLflow runs and returns the highest-performing model based on the primary evaluation metric.

---

## Drift Monitoring

Run drift detection:

```bash
python src/monitor_drift.py
```

Outputs:

* Drift summary in terminal
* HTML drift report saved to `reports/`

---

## Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna
* Model deployment with FastAPI
* Containerization with Docker
* Cloud deployment using AWS
* Automated retraining workflows
* Real-time monitoring dashboards

---

# Data Drift Analysis

## Summary

A drift analysis was performed using Evidently to compare the reference dataset against a current dataset. Several features exhibited measurable drift.

## Drifted Features

* age
* cholesterol (chol)
* resting blood pressure (trestbps)

## Potential Impact

Changes in the distribution of these features may reduce model performance because the model was trained on historical patterns that may no longer represent the current patient population.

Potential effects include:

* Reduced prediction accuracy
* Lower F1 score
* Increased false positive and false negative rates

## Recommended Action

The model should continue to be monitored regularly. If drift persists or model performance declines below acceptable thresholds, retraining using more recent data is recommended.

## Conclusion

Although the model remains operational, continued monitoring and periodic retraining are advised to ensure reliable heart disease predictions.
